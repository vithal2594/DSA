1	Longest Subarray of 1s After Deleting One Element	arr = [1,1,0,1]	Max 1s you can get by deleting a single element.
2	Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Any Window of Size K	arr=[1,5,9,12], k=2	Minimize range in a window of size k.
3	K Closest Points to Origin (Sliding on Sorted Distance)	points=[[1,3],[-2,2]], k=1	Keep top k closest points in a window.
4	Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums	nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3	Track smallest sums using window of k size.
5	Find K Closest Elements	arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3	Slide a window to find k closest numbers to x.
6	Maximum Average Subarray I	nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4	Return max average in fixed window.
7	Max Frequency of Element after At Most K Increments	nums=[1,2,4], k=5	Use sliding freq map to track elements.
8	Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays	A=[1,3,2], B=[2,1,3]	Track commonality between sliding prefixes.
9	Find Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make	coins = [1,1,1,4]	Simulates a fixed expansion sliding strategy.
